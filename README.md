# upgraded-octo-lamp

A creative exploration of contemporary culture, luxury, technology, and identity.

## Contents

- [Creative Ride Concepts](CREATIVE_RIDE_CONCEPTS.md) - An interpretation of modern polymath identity, luxury vehicle culture, tech ecosystems, and cultural convergence
- [Vision Detection with Erlang/OTP and Elixir](VISION_DETECTION.md) - Advanced vision detection implementation leveraging BEAM VM's concurrent and fault-tolerant architecture
- [Vision Detection Examples](EXAMPLES.md) - Practical code examples demonstrating Erlang and Elixir vision detection usage
- [Valency Checker](VALENCY_CHECKER.md) - Lightweight edge semantics with ambiguity elimination using compact lexicon and stemma (< 6KB)
- [Valency Checker Examples](VALENCY_CHECKER_EXAMPLES.md) - Practical examples of edge semantics and valency-based NLP

## Themes

This repository explores the intersection of:
- **Polyglot & Polymath Identity** - Multi-lingual and multi-disciplinary excellence
- **Luxury Vehicle Culture** - The evolution of status symbols from Rolls Royce to modern trucks
- **Automotive Heritage** - GTA, GTO, and the pursuit of performance
- **Tech Culture** - Apple's walled garden and digital ecosystems
- **Geographic & Cultural Convergence** - From South Korea's concrete modernity to Crenshaw's cultural authenticity
- **Vision Detection Technology** - Concurrent, fault-tolerant computer vision systems using Erlang/OTP and Elixir
- **Edge Semantics** - Lightweight NLP with the Valency Checker requiring only kilobytes for lexicon and stemma, enabling ambiguity elimination without cloud latency
